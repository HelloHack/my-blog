All right. I think can write down the first post on my new tech blog site now.

I am Android developer but also interested to web programming.
This blog is my test lab for playing around frontend skills. 
For people who interested, the backend is written by Java and frontend is base on AngularJS and Bootstrap.
I should talk a bit more about its implementation details some days later.

Most likely I will talk about my findings in my daily coding life on this blog site.
My favorite topics includes Android, Java, Linux, Design Pattern, so on so forth.
But I hope I may talk about other things as well. 

My old blog is [cpaul.is-programmer.com](http://cpaul.is-programmer.com/). 
But I haven't update it for a long time. 
Somehow, I notice some of my old posts still get network traffic.
Maybe I will find a way to migrate my old posts to this new web site someday.

In the end, the first post is named for a particular reason. People like me should know what it means.

Peace out for now :)
